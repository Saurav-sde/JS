## Introduction 👋

In this tutorial, we will explore different JavaScript events associated with forms. From detecting when the user interacts with the form to collecting form data, we'll cover all the important concepts that help us handle forms efficiently. And yes, we’re going to use **FormData** to make our life easier! 😎

## Event Listeners 👂

### 1. **Input Event ⌨️**
This event triggers whenever there is any change in the input field. It's like when you're typing, and JavaScript knows it! 🎯
```js
form.addEventListener('input', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);  // Logs the value as you type
})
```

### 2. **Change Event 🔄**
Triggered when the input field loses focus and has been modified. Think of it like changing your mind and then committing to it! 😅
```js
form.addEventListener('change', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);  // Logs the value after focus change
})
```

### 3. **Focus and Focusin Events 🔍**
- **focus**: Doesn't bubble. It’s attached to individual input fields.
- **focusin**: Bubbles. So we can attach it to the form element itself and catch focus events on all inputs! 👀
```js
form.addEventListener('focusin', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);  // Logs the value when focus is on an input
})
```

### 4. **Blur and Focusout Events 💔**
- **blur**: Doesn’t bubble, attached to individual input fields.
- **focusout**: Bubbles, and it happens when you move the focus out of the element. 🫣
```js
form.addEventListener('focusout', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);  // Logs the value after focus is moved out
})
```

### 5. **Click and Double Click Events 👆👆**
- **click**: Gets triggered when you click anywhere in the form. No special skills needed! 😄
- **dblclick**: Double click the mouse to see the event trigger. Double the fun! 🐱‍🏍
```js
form.addEventListener('click', (event) => {
    console.log(event.target.value);  // Logs the value on a click
})
```

### 6. **Submit Event 📝**
Triggered when the form is submitted. But wait, your page reloads! Not anymore with `preventDefault()`! 🚫
```js
form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();  // Stops page reload
    console.log("Form submitted! 🚀");
})
```

### 7. **Reset Event 🔄**
Triggered when you reset the form (hit that reset button!). The form will clear all the input fields. 💨
```js
form.addEventListener('reset', (event) => {
    console.log("Form reset! 🔄");
})
```

## FormData API 📊

Sometimes, we need to handle multiple inputs in a form, and repeating the same code for each input is *so* last year. 🙄 Enter **FormData**! It’s a powerful API that allows us to collect all form data easily. Let’s explore it:

### How It Works 🛠️

The **FormData** object allows us to gather the form data in key-value pairs and perform different operations like looping through them or converting them into arrays.

```js
form.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const data = new FormData(form); // Collects all form data
    // You can access individual values using keys

    // Get keys, values, or both
    for (let key of data.keys()) {
        console.log(key);  // Logs all the keys
    }

    for (let value of data.values()) {
        console.log(value);  // Logs all the values
    }

    // Get entries as key-value pairs
    for (let [key, value] of data.entries()) {
        console.log(key, value);  // Logs key and value pairs
    }

    // Convert the entries to arrays
    console.log(Array.from(data.keys()));  // Array of keys
    console.log(Array.from(data.values()));  // Array of values
    console.log(Array.from(data.entries()));  // Array of key-value pairs
})
```

**Why is FormData awesome? 🤩**  
- No need to manually write code for every input!  
- Supports file uploads 📤  
- Supports all form types (inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.) 🛠️

## Conclusion 🎉

In this tutorial, we learned about different JavaScript events that allow us to interact with forms, such as `input`, `change`, `focusin`, `submit`, and more. We also explored the **FormData** API that helps us easily collect form data without the hassle of managing each input separately. 🙌

So, go ahead and try implementing these features in your own form handling projects. You’ve got this! 💪
