# Callback Functions in JavaScript ✨

Welcome to the wonderful world of **JavaScript Callbacks**! Let's dive into what callbacks are, how they work, and how to avoid the dreaded **Callback Hell**. Sit back, relax, and let the pizza 🍕 example guide you through the learning process!

## What is a Callback? 🤔

A **callback function** is a function passed as an argument to another function, to be "called back" later when the task is complete. It's like saying:

> "Hey JavaScript, once you're done fetching the user data, call me back so I can greet them!"

### Example without Callback
```javascript
function fetchUser() {
    console.log("Fetching the user detail....");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched successfully");  
        const name = "Saurav"; // Simulated data from the backend
        greet(name);
        meet(name);
    }, 2000);
}

function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}

function meet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, I will meet you in Delhi`);
}

fetchUser();
```
Here, the code works but lacks flexibility. You can't dynamically decide what to do with the fetched data.

### Example with Callback
```javascript
function fetchUser(callback) {
    console.log("Fetching the user detail....");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Data fetched successfully");  
        const name = "Saurav"; // Simulated data from the backend
        callback(name);
    }, 2000);
}

function greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
}

function meet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello ${name}, I will meet you in Delhi`);
}

function edit(name) {
    console.log(`${name} edited from the user detail..`); 
}

fetchUser(greet);
fetchUser(meet);
fetchUser(edit);
```
With callbacks, we decide what task to execute after fetching the data. This is more reusable and flexible!

## Callback Hell ⚡

### The Pizza Delivery Example 🍕
Think of a scenario where you order pizza from Domino's. Here's the sequence:
1. **Place the Order**
2. **Prepare the Pizza**
3. **Pick Up the Order**
4. **Deliver the Pizza**

Let’s implement it with callbacks:

#### Step-by-Step Implementation
```javascript
function placeOrder(callback) {
    console.log("Talking with Domino's");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Order placed successfully");  
        callback(); 
    }, 2000);  
}

function preparingOrder(callback) {
    console.log("Pizza preparation started...");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Pizza preparation done!");  
        callback();     
    }, 5000);
}

function pickupOrder(callback) {
    console.log("Reaching restaurant to pick up the order...");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Order picked up by the delivery boy"); 
        callback();      
    }, 3000);    
}

function deliverOrder() {
    console.log("Delivery boy is on the way...");
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("Order delivered successfully");        
    }, 5000);   
}

placeOrder(() => {
    preparingOrder(() => {
        pickupOrder(() => {
            deliverOrder();
        });
    });
});
```

#### Output
```
Talking with Domino's
Order placed successfully
Pizza preparation started...
Pizza preparation done!
Reaching restaurant to pick up the order...
Order picked up by the delivery boy
Delivery boy is on the way...
Order delivered successfully
```

### Problems with Callback Hell 
1. **Reduced Readability** 😳
   - Nested callbacks make the code harder to read and understand.

2. **Difficult Debugging** 🤦‍♂️
   - Tracking errors in deeply nested callbacks is a nightmare.

3. **Dependency Issues** ⚠
   - Each callback depends on the completion of the previous one, making it fragile.

## Callback to the Rescue ⚛
The solution to **callback hell** is to use modern JavaScript features like **Promises** or **Async/Await**, which make asynchronous code look synchronous and easier to manage.
